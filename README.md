Read me of product-preview-card-component step wise

1 -> created a main container which is used for centering the sub container with a background of very light pink.

2-> A sub container that holds every thing and is centered  vertically and horizontally.

3-> I Have Divided the component in two main parts, one whole part for the desktop image of the product and another for rest of the things like mibile view image, heading, paragraph, button and so on.

Thank you :).
